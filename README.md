# Greeting Cli

## Goals

1. A simple CLI lab that requires no logic, only interpolation.
2. It demonstrates the structure of a CLI lab and having a bin use a method defined in a library.

## Outline

1. Describe Overview, building the first part of a complex military program. The first thing you need to do is ask the user for their name. After taking the user's name, the program should greet the user with "Hello, <user's name>. How are you doing?."
2. Screenshots / video of working program.

2. Structure of program. Walk user through what code goes where, the lib and the bin.

3. Have them first build the greeting method and use the test suites to make that pass.

4. They should then build the program in `greet` to load that file with require_relative.

5. Greet should output a hello and ask their name.

6. It should take input.

7. They need to use that input in greet.

8. Show them how to walk through the errors in the CLI spec.
